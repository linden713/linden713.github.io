🔥**Welcome to My Page!**🔥

I am currently pursuing my degree in robotics at the University of Michigan, specializing in Robot Perception & Manipulation. My interests lie in learning and mobile manipulation.

I previously studied mechanical design, manufacturing, and automation at [Beijing University of Chemical Technology](https://www.buct.edu.cn/main.htm) for three years before transferring to the [University of Detroit Mercy](https://www.udmercy.edu/) for my fourth year in robotics.
